# my.dotfiles
you can use gnu [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) (or see tutorial [here](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/)) to quickly create symlink, and and run ```stow .```

if you feel my dotfiles is little bit ((cringe)) you can give me advice/teach me :)

1. you need to install:
    1. plugin manager for vim: [https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
    2. ripgrep for searching file: [https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
    3. plugin manager for tmux: [https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
    4. solargraph if you write ruby: [https://github.com/neoclide/coc-solargraph](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-solargraph)
2. for mac, maybe you need to set `option` as meta key for terminal
