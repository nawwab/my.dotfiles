# my.dotfiles
you can use gnu [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) (or see tutorial [here](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/)) to quickly create symlink, and don't forget to delete this README and other unnecessary files before running ```stow .```

if you feel my dotfiles is little bit ((cringe)) you can give me advice/teach me :)
